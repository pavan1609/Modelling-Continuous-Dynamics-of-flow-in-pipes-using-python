**## Introduction 

 
 In this task, we model the steady state and fully developed axial flow of Newtonian fluids in a cylindrical pipe, assuming the fluid is incompressible and axisymmetric with no radial velocity. In the first step, we will develop partial differential equations by using Navier-Stokes equations. Secondly, by using the finite difference method, we will approximate the PDE's into solvable differential equations. 


Assumptions:
Radial Component is zero: u(r) = 0 
Steady State fluid flow
Incompressible Fluid 
Pressure gradient in X direction 
Flow is axisymmetric
Ignoring Gravitational force
